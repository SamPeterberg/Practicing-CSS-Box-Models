# Rothko Painting using CSS and HTML
##https://sampeterberg.github.io/Practicing-CSS-Box-Models/
## Project Overview

This project is a digital recreation of a Rothko painting, built using HTML and CSS as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. The task involved replicating the minimalist and abstract style characteristic of Rothko's work, focusing on the subtle transitions and block structures that define his paintings.

## Features

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML file consists of a simple structure with div elements representing different color blocks.
- **CSS Styling**: The project heavily utilizes CSS for layout and design, including:
  - Application of the CSS Box Model to manage content, padding, borders, and margins.
  - Use of background colors and gradients to create the visual effect of a Rothko painting.
  - Layering techniques to position and size the color blocks correctly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the basic structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: Handles the design and layout, focusing on the Box Model and color manipulation.

## Learning Outcomes

- Mastery of the CSS Box Model, understanding how padding, borders, and margins interact with content.
- Experience in using CSS to create complex visual effects and layouts.
- Improved skills in HTML structure and semantic coding practices.
